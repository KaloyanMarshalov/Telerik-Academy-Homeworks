BARCELONA — Although specs and photos of its upcoming flagship, the HTC One M9, leaked days before the Mobile World Congress, HTC managed to keep one thing a secret: It partnered up with Valve to create a virtual reality headset called the HTC Re Vive.

The device will have many sensors, including a gyroscope, accelerometer and a laser position sensor, and it will track the wearer's entire surrounding environment — not just head movements. This means they will be able to explore their virtual environment, interact with objects and inspect them from all sides.

From a technical perspective, Re Vive will show a 1,200 x 1,080 screen in front of each eye, with refresh rates of 90 frames per second. An audio jack is supplied for connecting the headphones, and it will come with "ergonomic VR game controllers" for each hand.

HTC has set forth an ambitious timeline for the Re Vive: The developer edition will become available in spring 2015, and HTC says the consumer-ready variant should be available in time for 2015's holiday season.
